    <h2 id="intro">What is PMX?</h2>
    <p>It's the eXtended Permission Manager app for Android which makes it easy to set and review desired permissions on
        installed apps, keeping track of any undesired changes. Giving control on your device, it enables you to protect
        your privacy. See Github <a href="https://mirfatif.github.io/PermissionManagerX">README</a> and detailed app
        description on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">Play
            Store</a>. Or try it out. It's free, for the most part.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="perm_ref">Permission References</h2>
    <p>
        You can set a reference value for permission which can be backed up and restored on ROM change or device change.
        So it takes only a few moments to look at all installed packages and figure out which permissions aren't
        correctly set. Long press a permission to set or clear its reference state.

    <h2 id="adb_help">Using PMX with ADB</h2>
    <p><b><i>Note:</i></b> On some OEM ROMs the ADB functionality might be crippled due to lacking permissions or other
        restrictions. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about it. The following instructions apply to near-AOSP ROMs.
    </p>
    <p>If your device is not rooted, you need to turn <b>Wireless ADB</b> on before using PMX. Some devices have
        <b><i>ADB over Network</i></b> or <b><i>Wireless Debugging</i></b>
        setting available in <b>Developer options</b>:
    </p>
    <img class="small" src="adb_in_dev_options_1.webp" />
    <p>For others, you need to connect the device to a USB host like PC <b><i>once after every reboot</i></b>.</p>
    <p><b><u>Unhide Developer options screen:</u></b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Go to <b>Settings</b> -> <b>About</b> and tap <b>Build number</b> five to seven times.</p>
            <p><b>Developer options</b> should appear directly under <b>Settings</b> or in <b>Settings</b> ->

        <li>
            <p>Connect the device to the PC with a USB cable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>On PC open a terminal window (or command prompt on Windows) and run: <code>adb tcpip 5555</code></p>
            <p>You must have <code>adb</code> executable available on your PC to run the above command. If not here's
                the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads">download link</a>.

    <ol start="5">
        <li>
            <p>Disconnect the USB cable from the device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Connect your device and PC to a common Wi-Fi network.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Get the IP address of the device (usually in WiFi settings or in <b>Settings</b> -> <b>About</b>), say

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>On PC run: <code>adb connect 192.168.1.1</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Run again: <code>adb shell id -u</code>. It should print <code>2000</code> (or <code>0</code>).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Leave the <b>Android debugging</b> enabled. Run PMX app and check <b><i>ADB Shell</i></b> in drawer. It should

    <h2 id="versions">PMX Versions</h2>
    <p>PMX is available in two variants: <b>Paid</b> and <b>Free</b>.</p>
    <p>Paid version is released on <b>Play Store</b>. Free version is released on <b>GitHub</b> (and some other
        sources including F-Droid). Latest APKs for both variants are also posted in the Telegram support group.
    </p>
    <p>There's no free version on Play Store.</p>
    <p>Either Free or the Paid version can be installed on a device, not both at the same time. Free version
        must be uninstalled before installing the Paid one, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Free version available on <a
            href="https://android.izzysoft.de/repo/apk/com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">IzzySoft</a> is the same
        as released on <a href="https://github.com/mirfatif/PermissionManagerX/releases/latest">Github</a>. But
        the one available on official <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.mirfatif.permissionmanagerx">F-Droid
            repo</a> has different
        signatures. So it cannot be installed over the former two, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>In between the major releases some test (<b>beta</b>) releases are also published in the Telegram group only.
    </p>
    <p>You can update the <b>paid</b> version to the latest stable release either from Play Store or by
        installing the APK file posted in the Telegram group with <b>-ps</b> in the file name. Sometimes Google team
        may take up
        to 24 hours before the update is live in Play Store.
    </p>
    <p>You can update the <b>free</b> version to the latest stable release either from GitHub or by installing
        the APK file posted in the Telegram group without <b>-ps</b> in the file name.
    </p>
    <p>Paid version installed by merely downloading the <b>-ps.apk</b> file from the Telegram group won't work
        if
        you haven't purchased the app on Play Store.
    </p>
    <p>Once a new version is available for update, PMX app - when launched - shows a notification to download
        the update (provided that you've enabled the update check in settings). Play Store app also shows update
        notification according to your settings.
    </p>
    <p>If you've already downloaded and installed the latest release from the Telegram group, you won't get
        update
        notification in the app and Play Store won't show update available.
    </p>
    <p>Free version is completely <b>open-source and free</b>. Source code is available on GitHub. Anyone can
        view and download the code and build the app. We respect users' privacy, so there's nothing hidden,
        there are no back-doors, no trackers, no ads. And we don't collect users' data and information for any
        kind of analytics, profiling or for the sole purpose of selling. Even submitting a crash report is also
        at user's discretion, though highly recommended.
    </p>
    <p>One can purchase the paid version just to make a donation and/or to use the paid-only features. Other
        methods of making a donation are available in the Free version under <b>Donate</b> section. Developers
        can also <b>support the app development</b> by contributing to the source code e.g. by fixing a bug or
        adding a feature. Users can help us make the app better by testing the beta releases, reporting any
        crashes or glitches, suggesting improvements and new features, or translating the app to their native
        language.
    </p>

    <h3 id="paid_features">Paid Features</h3>
    <p>Paid version includes everything that's in the Free version, plus the following <b>extra features</b> which
        are also listed in the app under <b>About</b> section and in the Play Store description:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sort apps and permissions by different parameters</li>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li id="faq1" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>Why PMX requires root or ADB access?</b></p>
            <p>Android won't allow a normal user app to change other apps' manifest or AppOp permissions, even its own.
                Only reading AppOps without root or ADB is
                possible provided that hidden APIs are not blacklisted on your device, which is <a
                    href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces">very
                    unlikely</a> on Android 9+.
            </p>
            <p>That's why we run a separate process with high privileges to circumvent the restrictions.</p>
            <p>By default, the background process (daemon) is run with ADB UID (<code>2000</code>) or (if rooted) System
                UID (<code>1000</code>). On rooted devices UID can be changed in <b><i>Advanced Settings</i></b>.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq2" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>How does PMX change other apps permissions?</b></p>
            <p>PMX itself doesn't grant or revoke permissions of the apps. In fact no third party app is privileged to
                do that. It's the Android OS which controls apps' permissions. PMX just sends a request to the Android
                framework to change a permission's state. Now it's entirely up to Android how much it honors our
                request. Not all permissions are changeable. And if you are not able to change a permission's state
                using
                PMX, you won't be able to change it in any other way either.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq3" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>Why do some permissions revert to their old state soon after changing them?</b></p>
            <p>Usually they are AppOp permissions. Some AppOps are only used by Android for compatibility (e.g.
                LEGACY_STORAGE) and they don't actually control anything. If we explore their underlying working it's
                revealed that granting/revoking such permissions doesn't make sense.
            </p>
            <p>Some permissions cannot be changed if the app is targeting old Android version. Also some OEM ROMs behave
                weird when it comes to AppOps. We do not know exactly what changes your OEM has made to the stock AOSP
                code. That's why the statement on Github and Play Store: <i>"The app is tested on stock Android 7-11.
                    Some highly customized ROMs may behave unexpectedly."</i>
            </p>
            <p>Actually there come many more explanations if we dig every app and permission individually (which doesn't
                sound practical). As we know that PMX doesn't change other apps' permissions on its own, so even if for
                some unknown reason Android doesn't change a permission, or reverts it
                back immediately, there's nothing we can do to force it because these are the limitations at Android
                end. Rather, I should say this is how Android works.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq4" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>What are hidden APIs in Advanced Settings?</b></p>
            <p>The core functionality of PMX revolves around <b>Hidden APIs</b>. These are the capabilities required to
                perform tasks (like granting/revoking permissions) which can only be performed by privileged system
                apps. So these capabilities aren't available to normal user apps. But PMX uses these capabilities with
                the help of root or ADB. If <b><i>"Use Hidden APIs"</i></b> is checked, the app tries to use some of
                these capabilities without the help of root or ADB. But this is not very likely to work on Android 9+,
                so the box is auto-unchecked. Usually a user should not be concerned about this.
            </p>
            <p>If you are interested in underlying details please read <a
                    href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces">here</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq5" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>What should I select for Privileged Daemon UID in Advanced Settings? System or ADB?</b></p>
            <p>It matters only if you are using root, or ADBD on your device is running with root (which is not the case
                with the final user devices).
            </p>
            <p>Preferably use <b>System</b> (UID 1000) as it allows more privileges than <b>ADB</b> (UID 2000). E.g.
                changing <i>"System-Fixed"</i> permissions is possible only when running as system.

            <p><b>Why don't I see XYZ app in packages list?</b></p>
            <p>Please check <i>Exclusion Filters</i>. Almost all the stock Android packages are excluded by default.
                You can exclude / include any package you want from / to visible list.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq7" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>Why don't I see XYZ permission in ABC package?</b></p>
            <p>Please check <i>Exclusion Filters</i>.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq8" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>Why don't I see XYZ AppOp in ABC package?</b></p>
            <p>Please check <i>Exclusion Filters</i> if XYZ AppOp is excluded from visible list. Or ABC package might
                not be using XYZ operation. You don't need to be worried about this.</p>
            <p>But if you want to see the XYZ AppOp for all apps, go to <b>Exclusion Filters</b> -> <b>Extra AppOps,
                    never excluded</b> and check XYZ AppOp in the list.</p>
            <p>For instance, write <i>_CLIPBOARD</i> in search box (with <i>Deep Search</i> box checked) and you'll get
                all apps which used (or tried to use) <i>READ_CLIPBOARD</i> or <i>WRITE_CLIPBOARD</i> permission.
                Timestamp is also shown (but not for all AppOps).</p>
            <p>So if the app you are concerned about isn't in the search results, check both AppOps in the <i>Exclusion
                    Filters</i> list mentioned above.</p>

        <li id="faq9" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>What are <i>invalid permissions</i> in Exclusion Filters?</b></p>
            <p>If an app is requesting a manifest permission but it's not declared (provided) by Android framework or
                any of the installed packages, it's an invalid permission.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq10" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>What are <i>extra AppOps</i> in Exclusion Filters?</b></p>
            <p>Not all AppOps are being used for all installed apps. But you can enforce an AppOp to any app. Selected
                Extra AppOps appear in all apps' permission lists so that you can set them.</p>

        <li id="faq11" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>What are different AppOp modes and which one should I use?</b></p>
            <p>Normally you should <i>Allow</i> or <i>Ignore</i>. Or you may want to allow an operation only when the
                app is in <i>Foreground</i> (only on Pie+). <i>Deny</i> is the intense version of <i>Ignore</i> which
                may crash the requesting app. <i>Default</i> is the system's default behavior which differs for

            <p><b>Why does scanning apps takes so long?</b></p>
            <p>
                PMX gets a lot of information about apps. It includes package label, name, icon, UID, and its state
                (framework, system, user, disabled). For manifest and AppOp permissions the information includes
                permission name, state (granted, revoked, allow, ignore, deny, foreground, default), protection level
                (normal, dangerous, signature, development, privileged, fixed, AppOp) and AppOp's last access time. Then
                the set value of every permission is compared with the reference value and the reference state is
                decided (red, green or orange). After scanning all the permissions for every app, the count of
                visible vs total permissions and app's reference state is also shown in package information.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can turn on <i>Quick Scan</i> in settings to disable permissions scan. Or exclude as much
                information as you can in <i>Exclusion Filters</i> to speed up the scan process. Speed also depends on
                how much CPU and RAM your device spares for the apps. ROMs investing more on UI (like MIUI) are slower.

            <p><b>Is there a complete list of all permissions available with explanation?</b></p>
            <p>There's no complete list of permissions with description, at least in my knowledge. For some manifest
                permissions there is a brief description available which is shown when you tap a permission name in PMX
                app. For AppOps there's no description provided in Android.
            </p>
            <p>There are third part resources like <a href="https://android.izzysoft.de/applists.php?topic=perms">this
                    one</a> by Izzy. Android's <a href="https://developer.android.com">official developer site</a> and
                <a href="https://cs.android.com">source code</a> are also good sources for learning. With every new
                Android release some new permissions are added, and some also get obsolete. Also, not all permissions
                are needed to be taken care of by every user.

            <p><b>How PMX compares to XPrivacyLua? Can they replace each other?</b></p>
            <p>PMX is not designed to replace but to compliment XPrivacyLua. They have different design goals.</p>
            <p>XPrivacyLua hacks Android's standard functionality by hooking into internal APIs, using Xposed which
                replaces some Android libraries with the hacked ones. So we get extra functionality like feeding fake
                data to the apps and get notified of permission related events which we cannot know of by any other
                normal means.</p>
            <p>PMX on the other hand is not targeted to be a framework mod. It provides convenient access to some
                privileged APIs which normal apps cannot use. It's not hacking Android's standard functionality by any
                means. Most of the tasks PMX performs can also be performed from commandline, except a few like changing
                System-Fixed permissions.</p>
            <p>Rooting and Xposed are two strict requirements for using XPrivacyLua. PMX doesn't require any of the both
                for most part. Both aren't available for many devices or many users don't consider them as an option due
                to the technical difficulties involved, warranty void, SafetyNet failing and other issues.</p>
            <p>Here's a related <a href="https://github.com/mirfatif/PermissionManagerX/issues/9">issue</a>.</p>

        <li id="faq25" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>Why PMX requires INTERNET permission?</b></p>
            <p>As clearly stated in app description: <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> permission is required to
                make use of ADB over network. The only connection made outside the device is to check for updates (which
                you can disable in app settings).</p>
        </li>
        <li id="faq26" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>How much privacy friendly PMX is?</b></p>
            <p>We are not interested in you or your device. PMX is open source. You can go through the source code on
                Github. There's nothing hidden from the end user. We believe in our users being educated and
                well-informed of why they are using PMX. We respect your privacy, so no data is collected ever, even the
                crash logs. You may also want to see our <a

            <p><b>Is PMX spying on me using ADB over network?</b></p>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>PMX talks to <code>adbd</code> process over localhost (<code>127.0.0.1</code>). But there's no way to
                start <code>adbd</code> listen on localhsot only, and not on other network interfaces (because ADB is
                meant to be used externally from a PC). You can surely stop <code>adbd</code> listening from external IP
                addresses, if you can. PMX would still work, without any port being exposed externally.</p>
            <p>Also you can change <code>5555</code> port to whatever number you want in <b>Advanced Settings</b>. It's
                not hard-coded.</p>
            <p>Also ADB since Android 4.2 is meant to be protected with <b>RSA key authentication</b> (one of the
                strongest authentication mechanism). So even if the device is accessible from internet (which is highly
                <a href="https://android.stackexchange.com/a/205807/218526">unlikely</a>), no one can make an ADB
                connection without authentication.
            </p>
            <p>You can verify these claims in whatever way you want. We are here to assist you technically.</p>

            <p><b>Is PMX misusing root privileges to collect my data?</b></p>
            <p>We believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least
                    privilege</a>. But due to the restricted nature of Android operating system, PMX cannot function
                without having high privileges. What we can offer is, if you are a tech-savvy person, we can teach you
                how to make it difficult for apps to make internet connections, even with root privileges.</p>

        <li id="faq29" style="margin-bottom:10px">
            <p><b>I think PMX is useless. Why was it created?</b></p>
            <p>You are correct. PMX is not for everyone (and that's why it wasn't polished and released to public for
                years because we knew we've a very small audience). It's only for some extra tech-savvy souls who are
                extra-conscious about their privacy and device control. Majority of the phone users are just in the
                hands of their OEMs. They aren't aware of what's being done to them and their data. And it's fine.</p>
